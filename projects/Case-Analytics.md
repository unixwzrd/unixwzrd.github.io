### AI-Powered Insights into Family Court Data

Family courts struggle to recognize patterns of **parental alienation, manipulation, and coercive control** due to the sheer volume of legal documents and communication records. **Case Analytics** leverages **AI-driven forensic analysis** to bring **clarity and objectivity** to these disputes.

### The Problem

High-conflict custody cases generate **massive amounts of data**—court filings, co-parenting messages, emails, and legal transcripts. Identifying **subtle patterns of alienation** is time-consuming and often **subject to human bias**.

### The Solution

**Case Analytics** applies **AI-powered language modeling and behavioral analysis** to uncover **hidden patterns** in legal disputes by analyzing:

- **Court filings, parenting plans, and legal arguments**
- **Co-parenting communications (e.g., Our Family Wizard)**
- **Emails, text messages, and deposition transcripts**

By detecting **shifts in sentiment, contradictions, and alienation tactics**, our system helps legal professionals, researchers, and affected families present **objective, data-driven evidence**.

### Next Steps: Controlled Alpha Testing

We are preparing for an **alpha release**, refining AI models with real-world cases, and seeking **legal professionals, affected parents, and researchers** to contribute data and feedback.

If you're interested in **testing, research collaboration, or sponsorship**, [get in touch](/contact). Our goal is simple: **make parental alienation visible—where it was once hidden.**
