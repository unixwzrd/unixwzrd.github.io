Distributed Thinking Systems is working on several open source projects, but please go checkout our GitHub projects. For the past year I have been using a GitHub repository for my journal on my work with building Python libraries specifically for Apple Silicon, but have decided to consolidate all my work on this site. I have many interests in AI, machine learning, and distributed computing, and plan to bring some of those projects here.

You may check out my [GitHub Repository Here](https://github.com/unixwzrd) and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I hope to put more posts here detailing what I am working on.

I am also available to assist you with any projects you have involving Unix distributed systems and would enjoy helping you achieve success with your projects. Please contact me at [unixwzrd@unixwzrd.ai](mailto:unixwzrd@unixwzrd.ai) and we can discuss how I can help you with your projects and their success.
