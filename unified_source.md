I have a Jekyll website which I am trying to clean up and make consistent. In particular, I would like my projects to each have a blog of their own going from the master projects.md, to a dedicated page for the project which would be projectname.md along side a directory projectname which will contain all the blog entries.

Please take your time to understand the dependencies and look for optimizations in the forms of layouts, includes or refactoring. The python script fetch_og_data.py generates the items for projects, many of the current files are generated from this script, so the script must be changed if the includes and other files generated by it need to be changed.
- Takes input from _data/repos.yml
- The OG thumbnails for the projects page
- The _data/github_projects.yml
- Project index files, projects/projectname.md
- The blog directory foreach project
- A template in the blog directory tagged unpublished 
- Script generated data for the project should go in the include file for the project
- After the initial files in the project tree are generated, they will be updated manually at times
- Any dynamic or generated information should go in an include file for the project
- If the files in the projects directory exists, they should not be overwritten as this will become part of a CI/CD process.

There should be a structure like this:

projects.md
projects/
projects/projectname.md
projects/projectname/
projects/projectname/blog.md


Optimize and refactor where you can, such as includes, layouts and style components.

Possibly break the style.css/scss files into logical blocks for maintainability.

Ensure that everything is consistent paying attention to includes, embedded in pages and layouts.

Review and optimize the _config.yml and other files where possible.

All the files and the tree are in the following Markdown.

## Getting This Site Online

I’ve been working for the past three weeks to make this site public. Although it’s still under construction, I’m happy to announce that it is now online. There was a lot to do to get it working—researching hosting options, web frameworks, and more. Throughout this process, I’ve relied on several AI assistants to help me get the site up and running. I primarily use macOS as my development platform with VS Code, and up until about a week ago, I was using GitHub Copilot along with GPT-4o. However, I recently discovered Codeium and have decided to switch over to it as my in-IDE coding assistant.

<!--more-->

What sets Codeium apart from other AI coding assistants is its ability to use context that you specify in the form of custom instructions, much like ChatGPT, but it also uses local context in the form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from directories and repositories on your local machine. This is great because it has access to your codebase while you’re working inside the IDE.

Upgrading to the Pro/Teams version gives you access to their Llama 3.1 405B model, which has been fine-tuned on many languages and used for various projects. Its autocomplete is very good and quite fast. It integrates seamlessly with VS Code, but they also offer a command line version called “Termium.” Inside VS Code, you access it much the same way you access Copilot—either from the edit session or the chat sidebar. Codeium also provides usage statistics for how much you have been using Codeium and details on how you have been using it. The Pro/Teams version includes limited access to GPT-4o as well along with team statistics. This is my personal public profile with my current statistics: (https://codeium.com/profile/unixwzrd)

One of the standout features of Codeium is its ability to produce a set of references in response to a prompt, similar to what Perplexity offers. I still use ChatGPT and the GPT-4o model for brainstorming, coding solutions, and double-checking Codeium’s suggestions. Since Codeium doesn’t have Internet retrieval yet, ChatGPT fills that gap. Overall, I’m impressed with Codeium. It even costs less than Copilot—$10 a month with an annual subscription or $12 a month if paid monthly. I think I’ll be sticking with Codeium going forward and canceling my Copilot subscription, as Codeium appears to do everything Copilot can, but faster and better.

You can check out Codeium on their website. They have a free version available, so give it a try—they are constantly updating and enhancing their capabilities. You might make the switch too.

If you want to give Codeium a try head over to [Codeium](https://codeium.com) and check it out.

## I managed to get this site up and running finally in spite of AI.

Initially I wanted to use a web builder which would produce my HTML, CSS, and SCSS files, in a nice WISIWIG format and even tried out a couple of the web builder products. I mostly wanted something I could move to any hosting service available and did not want to get locked into a proprietary platform. I tried **Mobirise**, but didn't like their pricing model, you could buy lots of nice modules, but had to pay a recurring fee to use them, then I tried **Sparkle**, but there was a high learning curve for someone who is a s non-creative as me. I liked Sparkle, and might give it another ho sometime, but learning it was going to take a lot of effort.

Eventually I settled on a fairly simple web framework, Jekyll. It used familiar markdown fro its pages and could generate some content using Liquid, a sort of embedded programming language which would allow a bit of dynamic content creation for my site. It also had a fairly steep learning curve and Gaslight GPT would sometimes take me down a serpentine path, only to discover after a week, the solution I was looking for a very simple and if it kew about it, why couldn't it have told me the solution a week ago, I found this rather frustrating. For anyone who thinks they can build a system who is not a programmer, I'm not sure we are there yet. It's coming, but there was still a plot o times where I had to call GPT-4o out over things I knew were wrong, and have it go look on the web for a solution.

<!--more-->

The upside of the whole process is I now know, for the most part how everything is set up, know enough to know when GPT-4o is not giving me a straight answer, and I have learned a lot in the process, more than I wanted to, but I have the beginnings of a site I can build on. One nice thing was that support for different screen sizes was pretty much built-in to the CSS and SCSS, along with light and dark mode handling. Another thing was that having the source code allowed me to make easy customizations once I figured out the Jekyll layout and filesystem structure.

I used AI to assists me with things lie SCSS, CSS, HTML, Liquid for Jekyll, and it was not all slow going.  Many times the AI would send me down a rabbit hole for a week or so. This wasted a lot of time because on more than one occasion, GPT-4o would forgot what we were working on to begin with and give me a completely different page instead. Sometimes offering me solutions to issues which would not work , and then offer the same solutions again an hour or so later.  Sometimes the solution was 95% complete, but I needed that 5% in order to have a complete solution. Going in endless circles until I could fins a different approach to the same problem. This process was excruciating, and I have had to hack some Jekyll code myself, which was not my desire.

One instance was the menu bar items at the top of the page. It kept insisting to put a "navigation.yml" file in the _data directory and it would magically create the navigation menus.  It didn't and I'm sure there were some other steps to getting it to work. I'm sure others have come up with solutions for this, but mine ultimately required an additional tag to the front-matter of the markdown Jekyll Pages like this:

```markdown
{% raw %}
---
title: "Distributed Thinking Systems Blog"
layout: page
menu_item: Blog
permalink: /blog/
---
{% endraw %}
```

I had to create my own variable in the front-matter for "menu-item" which would be how the menu item would appear.

```markdown
{% raw %}
      <nav class="site-nav">
        <input type="checkbox" id="nav-trigger" class="nav-trigger" />
        <label for="nav-trigger">
          <span class="menu-icon">
            <svg viewBox="0 0 18 15" width="18px" height="15px">

            </svg>
          </span>
        </label>

        <div class="trigger">
          {%- for path in page_paths -%}
            {%- assign my_page = site.pages | where: "path", path | first -%}
            {%- if my_page.title -%}
            <a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url | relative_url }}">{{ my_page.`menu_item` | escape }}</a>
            {%- endif -%}
          {%- endfor -%}
        </div>
      </nav>
{% endraw %}
```

This fixed the issue, but created more items I need to put in my Font Matter for my Jekyll markdown. There were a number of places I had to come up with custom solutions, such as the [Emergency Services](/resources/emergency-recoveries.md) page.  I ended up using a data file, but getting the grouping to work out was a nightmare and several days of working with GPT-4o, and then the new o1 models came out and I decided to use it. The o1-preview had the issue solved in about 2 hours with a nice, fully functional solution..

I ended up using a data file structured like this:

```yaml
countries:
  - name: "USA"
    services:
      - { service: "Emergency Services", contact: "911" }
      - { service: "National Suicide Hotline", contact: "1-800-273-8255" }
      - { service: "Crisis Text Line", contact: "Text HOME to 741741" }
  - name: "UK"
    services:
      - { service: "NHS Helpline", contact: "111" }
      - { service: "Samaritans", contact: "116 123" }
  - name: "Australia"
    services:
      - { service: "Lifeline Australia", contact: "13 11 14" }
      - { service: "Beyond Blue", contact: "1300 22 4636" }
 ```

 To allow additional entries to be added with minimal effort, I ended up using a YAML file. The corresponding page for emergency-services.md had to have som custom liquid code adde to make the table display correctly along with SCSS code. The JEqually Liquid code I used looks like this:

```markdown
{% raw %}
{% assign row_class = "odd" %}
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Country</th>
      <th>Service</th>
      <th>Contact Number</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for country in site.data.countries.countries %}
      <!-- First service row for the country -->
      <tr class="{{ row_class }}">
        <td><strong>{{ country.name }}</strong></td>
        <td>{{ country.services[0].service }}</td>
        <td>{{ country.services[0].contact }}</td>
      </tr>

      <!-- Additional services for the country -->
      {% for service in country.services offset:1 %}
        <tr class="{{ row_class }}">
          <td></td>
          <td>{{ service.service }}</td>
          <td>{{ service.contact }}</td>
        </tr>
      {% endfor %}

      <!-- Alternate row classes -->
      {% if row_class == "odd" %}
        {% assign row_class = "even" %}
      {% else %}
        {% assign row_class = "odd" %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
  </table>
{% endraw %}
```

But it allowed me to make the grouping appear as it should.  All services in the country under a single color and no country name in the first column other than the first one.  This was no small feat on my part to get GPT-4o to do it, and in fact=, it took the o1-preview to do it. I will say that I am extremely impressed with the new o1 models and how they work.  They have saved me a lot of time and effort, and I would probably still be making small changes, unable to be where I am now.


Ultimately, I want to get back to coding and producing functional code for projects rather than a web site.

Utilizing **AI-driven insights** and **data analytics**, we work to detect and address early signs of alienation, preventing **emotional and psychological damage** before it takes root.

At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we also leverage our technical expertise across sectors to drive **responsible AI innovation**. Our work extends beyond family law to include custom **AI solutions** for various industries, from **digital forensics** to **distributed computing systems** architecture, ensuring technology serves the greater good. This combination of social responsibility and cutting-edge technology drives our mission forward.

We believe **responsible AI** should not only solve today’s problems, but anticipate and prevent future harm. This core value drives everything we do: supporting AI in **Unix/Linux/macOS environments**, developing and integrating systems which prioritize **ethics**, and ensuring technology is both accessible and beneficial for everyone.

We firmly believe all children need both parents in their lives. Forcing a child to reject one parent erases part of their personality and past without giving them the chance to understand why. Our mission is to ensure no child ever endures this experience again. **Children deserve to grow up free from abuse**, with the care and support of both parents.

## Overview
At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we specialize in solving complex challenges through **Artificial Intelligence**, **distributed computing**, and **innovative technology**. Our mission is to leverage these tools to combat the harmful effects of **parental alienation** in high-conflict divorce cases, offering solutions to prevent alienation before it starts.

**Parental alienation** is an extremely harmful form of child abuse, where one parent manipulates a child to reject the other parent. This can fracture families, leading to long-term psychological and emotional damage. Despite its impact, parental alienation often goes unrecognized in family courts, leading to harmful custody decisions.

Using **AI** and **data analytics**, we aim to identify early signs of alienation through patterns in communication and family dynamics. These tools offer new insights into custody decisions, ensuring they are made in the child’s best interest.

At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we are committed to providing solutions that empower families and help children maintain healthy relationships with both parents.

## What We Do
We specialize in:
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: Using AI to uncover patterns that prevent parental alienation.
- **Data Analytics**: Building tools to analyze communications, legal documents, and family dynamics, highlighting signs of alienation.
- **Distributed Computing Systems**: Designing scalable systems using Unix/Linux environments for AI and other solutions.
- **Digital Forensics & Data Recovery**: Offering advanced recovery and analysis, particularly for legal and family-related support.

## About Us
We focus on applying **AI** and **distributed computing** to address real-world challenges. Our primary focus is on analyzing communication patterns from high-conflict divorce cases to prevent long-term emotional damage from parental alienation.

If you are interested in contributing **data from past cases**, partnering in research, or supporting us in any capacity, please [collaborate with us](/collaborate/).

At the intersection of AI and family law, we are committed to protecting parents and children from the long-lasting damage caused by alienation. By leveraging cutting-edge AI, we analyze shifts in communication to prevent problems before they escalate.
