## Jekyll Service Management

### Using the Service Management Scripts

The project now uses a modular service management system with three main scripts:

#### 1. **Site Service (Orchestrator)**
The [utils/bin/site-service](../utils/bin/site-service) script manages both Jekyll and file watcher services:

```bash
# Start both services
./utils/bin/site-service start

# Start both services (fast mode, no OG refresh)
./utils/bin/site-service start -n

# Start both services (complete mode, with OG refresh)
./utils/bin/site-service start -r

# Restart both services (fast mode by default)
./utils/bin/site-service restart

# Restart both services (complete mode)
./utils/bin/site-service restart -r

# Stop both services
./utils/bin/site-service stop

# Manage individual services
./utils/bin/site-service -j start    # Jekyll only
./utils/bin/site-service -w start    # File watcher only
./utils/bin/site-service -j restart  # Restart Jekyll only

# Help
./utils/bin/site-service --help
```

#### 2. **Jekyll Site (Standalone)**
The [utils/bin/jekyll-site](../utils/bin/jekyll-site) script manages Jekyll independently:

```bash
# Start Jekyll server (complete mode)
./utils/bin/jekyll-site start

# Start Jekyll server (fast mode)
./utils/bin/jekyll-site start -n

# Restart Jekyll server (fast mode by default)
./utils/bin/jekyll-site restart
```

#### 3. **File Watcher (Standalone)**
The [utils/bin/file-watcher](../utils/bin/file-watcher) script manages the file watcher independently:

```bash
# Start file watcher
./utils/bin/file-watcher start

# Restart file watcher
./utils/bin/file-watcher restart

# Stop file watcher
./utils/bin/file-watcher stop
```

### Service Management Options

#### Refresh Control Flags
- `-n`: Fast mode (no OpenGraph refresh)
- `-r`: Complete mode (with OpenGraph refresh)

#### Service Selection Flags
- `-j`: Jekyll only
- `-w`: File watcher only

#### Default Behaviors
- By default, both services are started and managed together.

### What the Service Scripts Do
- **Site Service (Orchestrator)**: Manages both Jekyll and file watcher services.
- **Jekyll Site (Standalone)**: Manages Jekyll independently.
- **File Watcher (Standalone)**: Manages the file watcher independently.

### Service Status and Monitoring
- Use the service scripts to check status, restart, or stop services as needed.
