## Overview

At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we are constantly pushing boundaries with innovative projects in AI, data science, and distributed computing. We are committed to working on and supporting OpenSource Projects.

### Internal Projects

Our primary projects have to deal with applying data analytics and AI to court documents such as depositions, parenting reports, and interpersonal communications between parties involved in high-conflict divorce cases. The primary purpose is to detect and analyze patterns that may indicate parental alienation, before it happens.

### More to come

<div class=body>

More projects on the way and even some demos and how-to's for things like processing audio, for speech to text and interpersonal communications dynamics and analysis. It will take me a bit of time  to get things organized and some tutorials up, but I will be working non-stop to help provide some good information, both of what I can do and how you may be able to do some of this yourself.
