## Overview
At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we tackle complex challenges using **Artificial Intelligence**, **distributed computing**, and **innovative technology**. Our mission is to harness these advanced tools to combat the harmful effects of **parental alienation** in high-conflict divorce cases, offering solutions to prevent alienation before it starts.

**Parental alienation** is an extremely harmful form of child abuse where one parent deliberately manipulates a child to reject the other parent. This process can fracture families, leading to long-term psychological and emotional damage for the children involved. Despite its devastating impact, parental alienation often goes unrecognized or unaddressed in family courts, which results in children being placed in the custody of an abusive parent.

The effects of alienation reach far beyond the immediate family. Children may develop false perceptions about the targeted parent, often based on exaggerated or entirely fabricated claims. This manipulation can cause severe emotional harm, leading children to believe they were wronged, creating a lifelong emotional rift. Family members and legal professionals can unknowingly play a role in supporting the alienation, believing they are protecting the child from harm.

Using the power of **AI** and **data analytics**, our goal is to help identify early signs of alienation through patterns in communication and family dynamics. These tools have the potential to bring new insights into the court process, ensuring that custody decisions are made in the best interest of the child, preventing further emotional trauma.

Parental alienation is a complex and often misunderstood issue that requires innovative approaches to resolve. At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we are committed to providing solutions that empower families and help children maintain healthy relationships with both parents. Our work combines cutting-edge technology with a compassionate understanding of the lasting damage alienation can cause.

## About Us
We are passionate about using **AI** and **distributed computing** to address real-world challenges.
