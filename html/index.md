## Overview

At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we specialize in solving complex challenges through **Artificial Intelligence**, **distributed computing**, and **innovative technology**. Our mission is to leverage these tools to combat the harmful effects of **parental alienation** in high-conflict divorce cases, offering solutions to prevent alienation before it starts.

**Parental alienation** is an extremely harmful form of child abuse, where one parent manipulates a child to reject the other parent. This can fracture families, leading to long-term psychological and emotional damage. Despite its impact, parental alienation often goes unrecognized in family courts, leading to harmful custody decisions.

Using **AI** and **data analytics**, we aim to identify early signs of alienation through patterns in communication and family dynamics. These tools offer new insights into custody decisions, ensuring they are made in the child's best interest.

At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we are committed to providing solutions that empower families and help children maintain healthy relationships with both parents.

## What We Do

We specialize in:

- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: Using AI to uncover patterns that prevent parental alienation.
- **Data Analytics**: Building tools to analyze communications, legal documents, and family dynamics, highlighting signs of alienation.
- **Distributed Computing Systems**: Designing scalable systems using Unix/Linux environments for AI and other solutions.
- **Digital Forensics & Data Recovery**: Offering advanced recovery and analysis, particularly for legal and family-related support.

## About Us

We focus on applying **AI** and **distributed computing** to address real-world challenges. Our primary focus is on analyzing communication patterns from high-conflict divorce cases to prevent long-term emotional damage from parental alienation.

If you are interested in contributing **data from past cases**, partnering in research, or supporting us in any capacity, please [collaborate with us](/collaborate/).

At the intersection of AI and family law, we are committed to protecting parents and children from the long-lasting damage caused by alienation. By leveraging cutting-edge AI, we analyze shifts in communication to prevent problems before they escalate.
