## Seamless PyTorch Adaptation for Apple Silicon and CUDA  

Many **PyTorch-based projects** are designed with **CUDA-first assumptions**, leading to compatibility issues when running on **Apple Silicon**. **Torch Adaptive Hook** is a lightweight wrapper that **dynamically adjusts PyTorch calls** to ensure smooth execution on both **CUDA and Metal-backed** Apple hardware.

### Why This Matters  

For AI researchers and developers working across different hardware architectures, maintaining **cross-platform compatibility** is often a challenge. This tool provides an **automatic bridge**, so PyTorch operations are routed to the correct backend without manual intervention.

### Key Features  

- **Automatically detects hardware** and applies the correct execution path  
- **Seamless integration**—no need to modify existing PyTorch code  
- **Optimized for Apple Metal and CUDA**, ensuring performance without extra configuration  
- **Works with AI and ML models**, reducing friction when switching between systems  

### Development & Availability  

This project is **actively developed** and available on **[GitHub](https://github.com/unixwzrd/torch-adaptive-hook)**. Future updates may include **enhanced optimizations for mixed-device workflows**.

For installation, usage, and technical details, see the project’s **[README](https://github.com/unixwzrd/torch-adaptive-hook)**.
