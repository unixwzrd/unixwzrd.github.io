Parental alienation remains one of the most difficult and heartbreaking challenges in high-conflict family dynamics. When one parent actively undermines the child's relationship with the other, the consequences can be devastating. Unfortunately, these behaviors often manifest subtly-through messages, emails, transcripts, and voice communications-that are difficult to analyze manually.

To address this, we have developed an advanced, privacy-first AI system designed to detect and flag signs of parental alienation across a wide range of case materials. This system uses state-of-the-art natural language processing and speech analysis techniques to evaluate communication patterns, sentiment, emotional tone, and behavioral indicators, providing evidence-backed insights grounded in established psychological and legal standards.

### Key Features of Our Approach

Our system ingests and normalizes diverse data types, including court documents, transcripts, emails, text messages, co-parenting app reports, and recorded voice conversations. It processes these locally to maintain strict privacy controls, applying sophisticated sentiment and emotion analysis across entire conversations, rather than isolated statements. Vocal tone and inflection analysis add an important layer of understanding that goes beyond words alone.

Parental alienation remains one of the most difficult and heartbreaking challenges in high-conflict family dynamics. When one parent actively undermines the child's relationship with the other, the consequences can be devastating. Unfortunately, these behaviors often manifest subtly - through messages, emails, transcripts, and voice communications which are difficult to analyze manually.

The core engine combines modular pipelines for text and audio processing, enriched with explainability features so every flagged concern can be traced back to the original source. This traceability is crucial for transparency, legal admissibility, and building trust among users and professionals alike.

A custom AI knowledge base is built for each case, enabling personalized analysis and contextual understanding. The system also incorporates threat scoring aligned with psychological risk levels to help prioritize intervention needs.

### System Design Overview

While the underlying technical architecture is complex, the system is designed to be modular, extensible, and user-friendly. Key components include:

- Data ingestion pipelines for flexible, secure processing of multiple formats
- Contextual sentiment analysis that understands dialogue flow and speaker roles
- Speech transcription with diarization and emotional tone detection
- A vectorized index for semantic search and retrieval-augmented AI summarization
- Explainable outputs linking flagged items directly to evidence
- A feedback module to help users improve their own communication tone and patterns

This design ensures the system remains adaptable as new research emerges and user needs evolve.

### Invitation to Participate, Collaborate, and Receive Assistance

We currently have several users and professionals testing the system and providing valuable feedback. However, to refine the AI's accuracy and practical usefulness, we are actively seeking additional participants-whether individuals, families, or law firms-who are involved in high-conflict custody cases.

By sharing anonymized documents and communications, participants help improve the system's detection capabilities and user experience. We maintain strict confidentiality and data security, with all processing done locally or under user control.

In addition to testing participation, we offer direct assistance services to those involved in high-conflict divorce or custody cases. Our expert team can help analyze case materials, generate detailed reports, and provide actionable insights using the AI system. These services aim to empower clients and legal teams with better information to support their cases.

### Custom AI Knowledge Base and Services

For clients, we provide a tailored service to convert and onboard case data into a private AI knowledge base. This personalized AI assistant can generate in-depth analyses, prepare case summaries, and assist with documentation. Pricing for these services depends on the volume and complexity of the data handled.

#### Why Work With Us?
