This is a series of posts about parental alienation, presenting the facts, the numbers, the effects, and the damage done when one parent uses a child as a weapon against the other parent.

*If you've landed here, you probably know the feeling: losing a child not to fate, but to lies, manipulation, and a broken system that looks the other way. Maybe it happened overnight. Maybe it happened right in front of you, slow and silent, until one day your kid stopped calling you "dad" or "mom" at all.*

I'm Mike Sullivan, and I'm not a lawyer, a therapist, or a lobbyist. I'm a dad-a caring, loving parent, just like many of you.

It's been a little over six years since my son was taken from me-abducted, really, in violation of court orders and common sense. Six years of silence. Six years where I've missed birthdays, milestones, all the little things that should have been ours. If you're here, you probably get it-this isn't just some family spat. It's a kind of grief you don't get over.

For a while, I thought I was the only one living this nightmare. Then I found out-there are *millions* of us. Parents, grandparents, siblings, even kids themselves. It's an epidemic, hiding in plain sight. It doesn't care what language you speak, how much money you make, or who you are.

I built this project because if nobody talks about this, nothing ever changes. The research is clear-parental alienation is abuse. The numbers are staggering. The stories are heartbreaking. And the system, as it stands, is failing far too many families.

So, what is this place? It's a living resource:
- I'm digging into the real data-how big this problem is, who it happens to, what it does to people.
- I'm sharing the facts, but I'm also sharing the human side-my story, and the stories of others who are fighting back.
- You'll find research summaries, resources, and maybe some hope.
- And you'll find a call to action, because if we don't raise our voices, who will?

Children need both caring and loving parents. They are not weapons. There are no winners in this-only the scattered wreckage of families torn apart. No one deserves this: not the children who have to repress their feelings and emotions to survive, while denying an entire part of their lives ever existed. No parent should have to experience this. It is losing a child without any closure. As I try to resolve it in my mind, it is like having a child on a ship lost at sea, whereabouts unknown-no closure, no answers, no way to know if they are alive or dead. The longer they are away, the worse it becomes for both child and parent, with the chances of reunification slipping away with each passing day.

### Make Your Voice Heard

One of the biggest problems with parental alienation is no one is ever held accountable for their actions, which only perpetuates the tragedy. They get away with it, and no one draws the line for them to face the consequences.

Help eliminate the tragedy of parental alienation and make those responsible for it accountable. It is important to make our political leaders address this extremely serious and damaging issue.
