Managing Python virtual environments sounds simple - until your projects grow, your dependencies tangle, and suddenly you're knee-deep in broken builds and lost environments.

**Venvutil** started as a small set of Bash scripts to make managing virtual environments a little less painful. It has since evolved into a powerful toolkit that handles everything from creating, activating, and cloning environments to logging every change and enabling full environment rollbacks - all without leaving your shell.

## Why It Matters

Pip and Conda both do great work, but they leave gaps:
- There's no easy way to snapshot your environment before changes.
- Cloning environments isn't seamless, especially when switching Python versions.
- Tracking environment changes over time is tedious - and recovery after a mistake can be painful.

**Venvutil** closes those gaps.

It wraps around `pip` and `conda`, providing a unified set of tools that:
- Create, activate, and clone environments effortlessly.
- Freeze and diff environments with a single command (`vdiff`).
- Log every potentially destructive operation automatically.
- Roll back environments to a previous state in seconds.

## Built for Developers

Whether you're experimenting with LLMs, fine-tuning performance builds (like optimized NumPy), or just managing a growing set of projects, venvutil keeps your environments organized, reproducible, and auditable.

- Works seamlessly on **macOS** and **Linux**.
- Optimized for **Apple Silicon** workflows.
- Lightweight - pure Bash and standard tooling, no external dependencies needed beyond Conda and Python.

## Coming Soon: Migration Magic

A Python version migration tool is on the roadmap:
- Duplicate an entire environment onto a new Python version.
- Keep your packages intact.
- Roll back easily if something breaks.

## Get Involved

If you want better control over your Python environments - and fewer late-night debugging marathons - check out the project on GitHub:
