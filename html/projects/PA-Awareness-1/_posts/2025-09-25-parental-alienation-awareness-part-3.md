## 3. Harms and Consequences for Children and Parents

Parental alienation inflicts **serious and often lasting harm** on both the children and the targeted parent. Leading researchers and clinicians consider **alienation a form of trauma** - with psychological effects comparable to other adverse childhood experiences. Here we break down the known consequences:

**For alienated children (short-term):** A child who is manipulated into rejecting a loving parent experiences immense psychological turmoil. Children naturally crave love and stability from both parents; alienation disrupts this fundamental need. **Clinical reports and studies have documented a range of negative outcomes**, including: **heightened anxiety and depression, phobias, feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, anger issues, and loyalty conflicts**<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_2_53_60"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_2_53_60">1</a>,</sup> <sup id="ref-source-1_6_0_5_269_277"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_6_0_5_269_277">6</a></sup>. The child's **school performance often declines** - many alienated kids exhibit concentration problems and falling grades<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_2_53_57"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_2_53_57">1</a></sup>. Some develop **behavioral issues or conduct disorders** as a reaction to the stress<a id="ref-source-1_1_1_2_53_60"></a>. In extreme cases, children have even **attempted or contemplated suicide** due to the emotional pain of the parental divide<a id="ref-source-1_1_2_2_53_60"></a>. A 2022 review notes that alienated children often show *"depressive symptoms, anxiety, poor self-esteem, lack of trust in relationships, and self-defeating behavior"*, even into later life<sup id="ref-source-1_6_1_5_269_277"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_6_1_5_269_277">6</a></sup>. Essentially, being taught to hate or fear one parent **distorts a child's reality and sense of security**, which is psychologically devastating.

Furthermore, alienated children often exhibit what Dr. Gardner called *"PAS symptoms"*: an unjustified **campaign of denigration** against the targeted parent, weak or frivolous justifications for the hatred, **lack of ambivalence** (the alienated parent is all bad, the other parent all good), borrowed scripted language, etc.. These behaviors indicate how the child's healthy perceptions have been replaced with the alienator's narratives. The **immediate harm is a shattered parent-child attachment**, but it doesn't stop there - the child's **identity development** is altered. Studies find alienated kids can develop a *"confused sense of self"* and difficulty trusting their own perceptions<sup id="ref-source-1_9_0_18_243_252"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_9_0_18_243_252">8</a></sup>. They may become emotionally dependent on the alienating parent in an unhealthy way, almost akin to a **cult dynamic** (indeed, researchers have likened alienating parents' tactics to those of cult leaders in how they indoctrinate and isolate the child)<sup id="ref-source-1_9_0_18_211_220"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_9_0_18_211_220">8</a></sup>.

**For alienated children (long-term adulthood):** The trauma of alienation often carries forward into adulthood - even if the child later reunites with the rejected parent, the psychological scars remain. Research by Dr. Amy J. L. Baker, who interviewed adults who were alienated as children, found consistent *long-term effects* in several key domains. In a study of 38 adult children of parental alienation, Baker identified **seven major areas of impact**: **(1) low self-esteem, (2) depression, (3) drug/alcohol abuse, (4) lack of trust in others, (5) alienation from their own children, (6) higher likelihood of divorce, and (7) other persistent emotional issues**<sup id="ref-source-1_10_0_36_15_22"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_10_0_36_15_22">9</a></sup>. In other words, these individuals struggle with mental health and relationships throughout life. They often have difficulty forming stable trustful relationships (having internalized distrust from the parental conflict), may self-medicate with substances or develop other maladaptive coping mechanisms, and sadly may even replicate the cycle in their own families. Indeed, researchers have observed **intergenerational transmission** of alienation: an alienated child, upon becoming a parent, is at greater risk of experiencing alienation again - either by choosing a high-conflict partner or by unknowingly behaving in dysfunctional ways learned from the past<sup id="ref-source-1_9_0_18_153_161"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_9_0_18_153_161">8</a></sup><a id="ref-source-1_9_0_18_247_256"></a>. One qualitative study of 20 international adults alienated in childhood noted **elevated rates of anxiety disorders, trauma symptoms (akin to PTSD), and suicidal ideation** in these individuals<sup id="ref-source-1_9_0_18_147_156"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_9_0_18_147_156">8</a></sup><a id="ref-source-1_9_0_18_153_160"></a>. Many described enduring emotional pain and confusion about their identity, even years later. Crucially, even those who eventually understood the alienation and reconciled with the targeted parent often **felt a profound sense of loss and regret** for the years of missed relationship - a form of grief that can persist indefinitely.

It's also important to note that **physical health can be affected**. Chronic stress in childhood (such as the stress of being embroiled in parental alienation) correlates with worse health outcomes later (higher risk of chronic illness, etc.). Alienated children may develop **psychosomatic complaints** (headaches, stomach aches related to anxiety) and often need more medical or therapeutic intervention<sup id="ref-source-1_8_0_35_115_124"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_8_0_35_115_124">7</a></sup><a id="ref-source-1_8_0_35_165_173"></a>. A UK foundation report found that children of highly conflicted separations (who likely include alienation cases) have higher probabilities of needing medical treatment, engaging in risky behaviors (early sexual activity, smoking, drinking), and other adverse outcomes in adolescence<sup id="ref-source-1_8_1_35_115_124"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_8_1_35_115_124">7</a></sup>. In summary, **the life trajectory of an alienated child can be severely derailed** - emotionally, socially, and even physically. The effects can touch education (dropping out earlier), economic status (lower earnings in adulthood), and the ability to form a healthy family of their own<a id="ref-source-1_8_0_35_115_123"></a><sup id="ref-source-1_9_1_18_243_252"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_9_1_18_243_252">8</a></sup>.

**For targeted parents:** The mother or father who is the target of alienation arguably suffers one of the most painful experiences a parent can endure: **the loss of a child's love and contact while being helpless to stop it**. Targeted parents often describe symptoms of **traumatic stress** - and research confirms this. A 2019 study that measured targeted parents' mental health found **high levels of depression and PTSD-like symptoms**, and even elevated **suicidal ideation**, among parents alienated from their children<sup id="ref-source-1_2_0_8_35_39"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_2_0_8_35_39">2</a>,</sup> <sup id="ref-source-1_11_0_16_13_21"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_11_0_16_13_21">10</a></sup>. In that study, alienated parents had significantly worse scores on depression and trauma questionnaires compared to both the general population and even compared to other divorced parents who were not alienated<sup id="ref-source-1_11_0_16_37_45"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_11_0_16_37_45">10</a></sup><a id="ref-source-1_11_0_16_61_69"></a>. The more severe the alienation (e.g. the longer since they've seen the child, or the more extreme the rejection), the **more severe the depression and trauma symptoms** reported<a id="ref-source-1_11_1_16_61_69"></a>. Over **60% of targeted parents in one survey had contemplated suicide within the past year** - a staggering figure that underscores the despair this situation can induce<sup id="ref-source-1_11_0_16_79_87"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_11_0_16_79_87">10</a></sup>. Tragically, there have been cases of alienated parents dying by suicide (for example, a well-known case mentioned by Harman & Biringen, 2016, where a father took his life)<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_2_55_61"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_2_55_61">1</a></sup>.

In many ways, targeted parents experience a form of **"ambiguous loss" or complicated grief**. Their child is *not dead*, but due to the alienation, it feels as if the child is "gone" - yet with the tormenting uncertainty that perhaps someday the relationship could be restored. This ambiguous loss can be more difficult to process than a clear-cut loss. It's compounded by feelings of **betrayal, frustration with legal systems**, social isolation (friends/family often don't understand or may even blame the parent), and the **pain of character assassination** (alienators often vilify the targeted parent with false accusations of abuse, etc., leaving the parent fighting to clear their name). Studies have noted that many alienated parents exhibit symptoms consistent with **post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)** - nightmares, intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance - as well as **major depression** (feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness)<sup id="ref-source-1_11_1_16_13_21"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_11_1_16_13_21">10</a></sup><a id="ref-source-1_11_0_16_55_64"></a>. The 2019 Harman study specifically found that **targeted parents had significantly higher depression and trauma scores than even parents who were themselves engaged in two-sided conflict**, indicating the unique toll of being the sole victim in these scenarios<a id="ref-source-1_11_0_16_53_61"></a>.

Beyond mental health, targeted parents can suffer **financial and functional impairments**. Many spend tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees in desperate attempts to maintain or restore custody/visitation (draining their savings and retirement). The stress can impact their job performance; some miss work for court dates or fall into unemployment due to depression. Socially, they may withdraw due to shame or because they are cut off from their children's lives (no more school events, etc., which also often were a key social outlet). The harm often qualifies as **domestic violence by proxy** - the alienating parent is effectively using the child to continue abusing the ex-partner (the targeted parent). As one research team put it, *"the consequences for targeted parents can be severe... [parental alienation] could be considered a form of ongoing domestic violence perpetrated on them by the offending parent."*<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_2_55_62"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_2_55_62">1</a></sup>.

In sum, **parental alienation exacts a severe psychological toll on everyone directly involved** except perhaps the alienating instigator (who often may have their own psychopathologies driving their behavior). Children suffer emotional abuse that can last a lifetime; targeted parents suffer a living grief and trauma; even extended family (grandparents, etc., who lose the child) experience loss. Because of these far-reaching harms, experts emphasize that **parental alienation should be treated as seriously as any other form of child abuse or family violence**<sup id="ref-source-1_6_1_5_277_283"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_6_1_5_277_283">6</a></sup>. Early recognition and intervention are key to preventing these outcomes - a topic we'll touch on in the final sections regarding systemic responses.

Stress-related physical symptoms (headaches, stomach aches); in the long run, potential health issues from chronic stress (weaker immune function, etc.). | Physical health can deteriorate due to chronic stress (e.g. high blood pressure, insomnia). Many report fatigue, loss of appetite or overeating, and other stress-induced conditions. Financial strain can also affect healthcare access. In extreme cases, targeted parents have died by stress-related illness or suicide linked to alienation<sup id="ref-source-1_1_1_2_55_61"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_1_2_55_61">1</a></sup>. |

Many targeted parents never fully recover their prior life satisfaction unless the parent-child relationship is healed. |
