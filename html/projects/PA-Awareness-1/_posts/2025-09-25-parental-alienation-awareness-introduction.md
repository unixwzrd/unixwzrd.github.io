## About Parental Alienation Awareness

Parental Alienation Awareness: A comprehensive research paper examining the scope, impact, and damage of parental alienation to children, families, and society. Our research provides evidence-based analysis of this widespread but often misunderstood phenomenon.

## Research Paper Sections

Our comprehensive research paper is organized into five interconnected sections:

1. **[Prevalence and Scope of Parental Alienation](/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-part-1/)** - How common is parental alienation and who is affected?

2. **[Perpetrators and Victims: Who Alienates and Who Is Alienated](/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-part-2/)** - Understanding the dynamics of alienation relationships.

3. **[Harms and Consequences for Children and Parents](/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-part-3/)** - The lasting impact on families.

4. **[Divorce, Custody Disputes, and the Legal System](/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-part-4/)** - How the legal system addresses and sometimes exacerbates alienation.

5. **[Systemic and Societal Impact](/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-part-5/)** - The broader consequences for society.
