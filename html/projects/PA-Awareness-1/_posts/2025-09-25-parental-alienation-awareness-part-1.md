## 1. Prevalence and Scope of Parental Alienation

**How common is parental alienation?** Recent research indicates it is far from rare. A landmark 2016 study using a representative U.S. survey found that **13.4% of parents** reported being alienated from at least one child<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_2_21_28"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_2_21_28">1</a></sup>. This equated to roughly **22 million American parents** at that time<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_4_334_343"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_4_334_343">1</a></sup> - implying tens of millions of children potentially affected (since many targeted parents have more than one child)<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_4_340_348"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_4_340_348">1</a></sup>. In fact, the authors estimate **between 22-44 million U.S. children** could be experiencing some level of parental alienation in their family<a id="ref-source-1_1_1_4_340_348"></a>.

More recent surveys suggest even higher exposure when broader "alienating behaviors" are considered. In 2018-2019, Harman et al. conducted national polls in the U.S. and Canada: **35.5% of U.S. parents** and **32% of Canadian parents** reported that their co-parent had engaged in **parental alienating behaviors (PABs)** - i.e. behaviors intended to damage the parent-child relationship<sup id="ref-source-1_2_0_8_25_33"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_2_0_8_25_33">2</a></sup>. Using a more detailed assessment, a third U.S. sample found **39.1%** of American parents to be **targets of alienation attempts** by the other parent<a id="ref-source-1_2_0_8_27_35"></a>. These findings **confirm earlier estimates** - on the order of 22 million U.S. parents affected - but also show that **over one-third of separated/divorced parents experience alienating tactics**<a id="ref-source-1_2_0_8_27_36"></a><sup id="ref-source-1_3_0_9_1375_1383"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_3_0_9_1375_1383">3</a></sup>. Not all of these cases result in a fully "alienated" child, but they reveal how widespread the *attempts* at alienation are.

International data echo these patterns. A 2025 U.K. survey of 1,000 separated parents (Hine et al.) found **39.2%** of respondents directly acknowledged experiencing parental alienating behaviors - and when presented with specific examples of such behaviors, the rate jumped to **59.1%**<sup id="ref-source-1_4_0_11_153_161"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_4_0_11_153_161">4</a></sup>. In other words, well over half of separated parents in that UK sample had encountered some form of alienation tactics. This study also noted that these behaviors often co-occur with other abuse (the use of children as "a conduit for abuse" by one parent)<a id="ref-source-1_4_1_11_153_161"></a>. Taken together, research from North America and Europe makes clear that **parental alienation is a common phenomenon across demographics and borders**<sup id="ref-source-1_3_0_9_1379_1388"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_3_0_9_1379_1388">3</a></sup>.

**How many children are affected?** Estimating child prevalence is challenging, since not all children subjected to alienating behaviors become fully "alienated"<sup id="ref-source-1_2_0_8_61_69"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_2_0_8_61_69">2</a></sup>. Earlier analyses approximated that around **1% of children** in the U.S. were alienated from a parent - roughly **740,000 minors** - based on divorce rates and high-conflict custody disputes circa 2010<sup id="ref-source-1_5_0_2_75_83"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_5_0_2_75_83">5</a></sup>. Newer data suggest this may be an underestimate. In the U.S. polls above, **6.7% of all parents** surveyed said **their child(ren) were moderately to severely alienated** from them<sup id="ref-source-1_2_0_8_33_39"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_2_0_8_33_39">2</a></sup>. This corresponds to **at least ~1.3% of the U.S. population** (if extrapolated nationally)<a id="ref-source-1_2_1_8_33_39"></a>, which would mean on the order of **4+ million children** experiencing serious alienation. One commentary even described parental alienation as a "silent epidemic," noting that **over 22 million American adults** have been targets, including **10 million who perceive their alienation as *severe***<sup id="ref-source-1_6_0_5_250_258"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_6_0_5_250_258">6</a></sup>. Globally, precise numbers are harder to come by, but if roughly 1 in 5 separated families worldwide experience these issues, the affected children likely number in the **tens of millions**.

**Demographic breakdown:** Parental alienation appears in all types of families - across socioeconomic, racial, and educational lines<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_2_25_33"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_2_25_33">1</a></sup>. The 2016 U.S. survey found targeted parents in every demographic, though **Black/African-American and Native American parents were over-represented** among those experiencing alienation (and Asian-American parents under-represented)<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_2_29_36"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_2_29_36">1</a></sup><a id="ref-source-1_1_0_4_362_370"></a>. There was no strong gender skew in that representative sample - **fathers were only slightly (and not significantly) more likely than mothers** to report being the alienated/targeted parent<sup id="ref-source-1_3_0_13_219_227"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_3_0_13_219_227">3</a></sup>. This aligns with broader evidence that **both mothers and fathers can be perpetrators or victims**. Historically, when mothers more often had primary custody, experts observed more mothers as alienators (Dr. Richard Gardner initially reported ~90% of alienating parents were mothers in the 1980s). However, as custody roles have evened out, modern estimates indicate an **approximately 50/50 gender split** in alienation cases. In short, **either parent can be the alienator or the targeted parent**, and cases span all ages and family structures. Notably, while most documented alienation occurs in divorced or separated families, it **can also occur in intact families** - one parent may undermine the other's relationship with the child even without a divorce<sup id="ref-source-1_1_0_2_83_90"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_1_0_2_83_90">1</a></sup>. Step-parents or other relatives (grandparents, guardians) can also participate in alienating behaviors in some cases<sup id="ref-source-1_2_0_8_43_51"><a href="/projects/PA-Awareness-1/2025/09/25/parental-alienation-awareness-references/#ref-target-1_2_0_8_43_51">2</a></sup>, though typically as part of a campaign led by one parent.
