If you've stumbled on this, you probably already know the pain of parental alienation-or you're starting to wonder if it's happening to you. You're not alone. The truth is, parental alienation isn't just a rare, unlucky circumstance. It's everywhere, affecting millions of parents and children, crossing every line you can imagine.

## 1. Prevalence and Scope of Parental Alienation

How common is parental alienation? Recent research indicates it is far from rare. A landmark 2016 study using a representative U.S. survey found that 13.4% of parents reported being alienated from at least one child. This equated to roughly 22 million American parents at that time - implying tens of millions of children potentially affected (since many targeted parents have more than one child). In fact, the authors estimate between 22-44 million U.S. children could be experiencing some level of parental alienation in their family.

More recent surveys suggest even higher exposure when broader "alienating behaviors" are considered. In 2018-2019, Harman et al. conducted national polls in the U.S. and Canada: 35.5% of U.S. parents and 32% of Canadian parents reported that their co-parent had engaged in parental alienating behaviors (PABs) - i.e. behaviors intended to damage the parent-child relationship. Using a more detailed assessment, a third U.S. sample found 39.1% of American parents to be targets of alienation attempts by the other parent. These findings confirm earlier estimates - on the order of 22 million U.S. parents affected - but also show that over one-third of separated/divorced parents experience alienating tactics. Not all of these cases result in a fully "alienated" child, but they reveal how widespread the attempts at alienation are.

International data echo these patterns. A 2025 U.K. survey of 1,000 separated parents (Hine et al.) found 39.2% of respondents directly acknowledged experiencing parental alienating behaviors - and when presented with specific examples of such behaviors, the rate jumped to 59.1%. In other words, well over half of separated parents in that UK sample had encountered some form of alienation tactics. This study also noted that these behaviors often co-occur with other abuse (the use of children as "a conduit for abuse" by one parent). Taken together, research from North America and Europe makes clear that parental alienation is a common phenomenon across demographics and borders.

How many children are affected? Estimating child prevalence is challenging, since not all children subjected to alienating behaviors become fully "alienated". Earlier analyses approximated that around 1% of children in the U.S. were alienated from a parent - roughly 740,000 minors - based on divorce rates and high-conflict custody disputes circa 2010. Newer data suggest this may be an underestimate. In the U.S. polls above, 6.7% of all parents surveyed said their child(ren) were moderately to severely alienated from them. This corresponds to at least ~1.3% of the U.S. population (if extrapolated nationally), which would mean on the order of 4+ million children experiencing serious alienation. One commentary even described parental alienation as a "silent epidemic," noting that over 22 million American adults have been targets, including 10 million who perceive their alienation as severe. Globally, precise numbers are harder to come by, but if roughly 1 in 5 separated families worldwide experience these issues, the affected children likely number in the tens of millions.

Demographic breakdown: Parental alienation appears in all types of families - across socioeconomic, racial, and educational lines. The 2016 U.S. survey found targeted parents in every demographic, though Black/African-American and Native American parents were over-represented among those experiencing alienation (and Asian-American parents under-represented). There was no strong gender skew in that representative sample - fathers were only slightly (and not significantly) more likely than mothers to report being the alienated/targeted parent. This aligns with broader evidence that both mothers and fathers can be perpetrators or victims. Historically, when mothers more often had primary custody, experts observed more mothers as alienators (Dr. Richard Gardner initially reported ~90% of alienating parents were mothers in the 1980s). However, as custody roles have evened out, modern estimates indicate an approximately 50/50 gender split in alienation cases. In short, either parent can be the alienator or the targeted parent, and cases span all ages and family structures. Notably, while most documented alienation occurs in divorced or separated families, it can also occur in intact families - one parent may undermine the other's relationship with the child even without a divorce. Step-parents or other relatives (grandparents, guardians) can also participate in alienating behaviors in some cases, though typically as part of a campaign led by one parent.

Table 1: Prevalence of Parental Alienation

| Metric (Latest Estimates) | United States | International |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Adults who report being targeted by parental alienation | ~22 million (â‰ˆ9% of U.S. adults; 13.4% of parents) | U.K.: ~39% of separated parents (59% when prompted); Canada: ~32% of parents |
| Children who are moderately-severely alienated from a parent | ~4 million (estimated 1.3% of U.S. population); older estimate ~740,000 (1% of U.S. children) | No precise national data; assumed proportionally similar in other countries |
| High-conflict custody cases involving alienation | ~25% of high-conflict divorces (Bernet 2010) - roughly 5% of all U.S. divorces (see Section 4) | U.K.: CAFCASS reports alienation in ~80% of most difficult cases (~200k cases/yr) |
