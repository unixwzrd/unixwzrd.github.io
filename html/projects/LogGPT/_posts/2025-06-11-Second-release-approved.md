After a long journey through Apple’s review process, I’m thrilled to announce that **LogGPT**, the Safari extension designed to let you **export your entire ChatGPT conversation history as structured JSON files**, is now officially available on the Apple App Store!

### Why LogGPT?

If you’ve ever wanted to **save, organize, or analyze your ChatGPT conversations** outside the OpenAI interface, LogGPT is the tool for you. With one simple click, you can download your full ChatGPT chat logs in a clean, structured JSON format—without any tracking, cloud dependencies, or complicated setups. Your conversations stay private on your device, giving you full control over your data.

This extension is perfect for:

- Archiving conversations for future reference or legal documentation  
- Extracting insights and formatting chats for reports, articles, or AI training  
- Seamless transfer of context between ChatGPT sessions to continue conversations without loss  
- Integrating with AI-powered workflows using companion tools for Markdown, HTML extraction, and chunking (available in my [VenvUtil](https://github.com/unixwzrd/venvutil) project)

### What’s New & Why It Took So Long

Getting LogGPT approved by Apple was quite the adventure. After an initial rejection due to branding similarities and icon issues, and updates to Apple’s policies requiring additional encryption declarations and regional restrictions (LogGPT isn’t available in China due to ChatGPT restrictions), the extension finally passed review.

This means you now have a **fully compliant, signed, and seamless Safari extension** that integrates naturally with the ChatGPT UI without intrusive elements or ads.
