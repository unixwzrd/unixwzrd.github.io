## This App Submitted for Review

I submitted the app to the Apple App Store for review. I would appreciate it of you would buy a copy from teh app store to help offset the Apple Developer Tax (cost of my Apple Developer Account).  Whether that or you could drop me something in my Patreon or Ko-Fi.

I really feel like I have accomplished something by getting the Safari extension submitted to Apple for review.  It is a simple extension that allows you to export your ChatGPT conversations to a JSON file.  It is a simple extension that allows you to export your ChatGPT conversations to a JSON file.  It is a simple extension that allows you to export your ChatGPT conversations to a JSON file.

The extension collects no data, and had no adds. It is simple and lightweight and simply downloads your Chat history into your download folder as a JSON file with the name of the conversation which OpenAI uses to identify the conversation.

There are many uses for this extension I have found, like printing chatlogs, referring back to them later, using them for content, and even splitting teh file and uploading it into a fresh ChatGPT instance to continue the conversation. More to come on the technique for doing that later.

## What's Next?

If you use the command line, I have tools in the [VenvUtil](https://github.com/unixwzrd/venvutil) project that will help you extract your conversations with ChatGPT from teh JSON into either HTML or Markdown.  Suitable for printing from your browser or using the Markdown for content, or saving and archiving conversations.
