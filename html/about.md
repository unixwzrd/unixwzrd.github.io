### Our Mission

Our primary technical focus is on **AI** and **distributed computing**. We are dedicated to applying these skills in ways that make a **positive societal impact**, particularly in **parental alienation**, a damaging form of child abuse where one parent manipulates a child to reject the other parent, sometimes creating false narratives or accusations. Utilizing **AI-driven insights** and **data analytics**, we work to detect and address early signs of alienation, preventing **emotional and psychological damage** before it takes root.

At **Distributed Thinking Systems**, we also leverage our technical expertise across sectors to drive **responsible AI innovation**. Our work extends beyond family law to include custom **AI solutions** for various industries, from **digital forensics** to **distributed computing systems** architecture, ensuring technology serves the greater good. This combination of social responsibility and cutting-edge technology drives our mission forward.

We believe **responsible AI** should not only solve todayâ€™s problems, but anticipate and prevent future harm. This core value drives everything we do: supporting AI in **Unix/Linux/macOS environments**, developing and integrating systems which prioritize **ethics**, and ensuring technology is both accessible and beneficial for everyone.

We firmly believe all children need both parents in their lives. Forcing a child to reject one parent erases part of their personality and past without giving them the chance to understand why. Our mission is to ensure no child ever endures this experience again. **Children deserve to grow up free from abuse**, with the care and support of both parents.
